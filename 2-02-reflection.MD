# 2.2 Reflection Questions

### 1. In your own words, describe what event driven programming is. What event handler was used in the I Have a Dream app? How was it used?

The program does something when the user interacts with the UI. The event handler used in the I Have a Dream app was the block of code that stated “when Button 1.Click, do call Player1 .Start.” It was used so that when the user pressed Button 1, Player1 would start, and the sound would play.

### 2. Is it possible to create an app without event driven programming? Explain.

 I don’t think that it’s possible to create an app without event-based programming, because all apps rely on the user to do something for the app to function.

### 3. What elements and components make up the User Interface (UI) for the I Have A Dream app?

 The user presses the image of MLK, and the program plays a sound clip. There are also labels above and under the MLK button.

### 4. What are some of the elements that make up the UI for a car? A vending machine?

Car: Steering Wheel, brakes, gas, lock button, radio
Vending Machine: Quarter slot, number buttons, credit card swiper
