# 2.10 Reflection Questions

### 1. (POGIL) Insert a screenshot of your Logicly diagram for the Exclusive-OR circuit below.

> To insert the image, upload the file to the repo on GitHub and name is something that makes sense (like logiclyDiagram.png). Then follow the formatting below this for your image to appear.

### 2. (POGIL) Consider these three things: The OR gate (i.e., the physical circuit), the Boolean OR function (as defined by its truth table), and the OR symbol. How would arrange them from most abstract to least abstract? And what criterion would you use to determine their order?

### 3. Consider these three things: A binary digit (e.g., 1 or 0), the flip-flop circuit diagram (), and the flip-flop circuit (i.e., the physical circuit). How would you arrange them from most abstract to least abstract and what criterion would you use to determine their order?
