### 2. Describe the functionality of your soundboard app shown in your video.

 This soundboard allows the user to hear an iconic clip from the movie “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” by pressing on a thumbnail from that scene.

### 3. Describe the purpose of your app. Why did you create it and how does it allow you to express yourself?

 I love Ferris Bueller more than life itself. I have seen it so many times, and it’s easily my favorite of all time. So, of course I made my soundboard about Ferris Bueller. This app allows me to express my love for Ferris Bueller by creating a soundboard with sounds centralized around iconic sounds form the movie.

### 4. Complete the following table by naming two UI components in your app, identifying the event handler used for each component, and describing what functionality the component contributes to your program.

The chart changed it's layout when I tried to copy and paste it form my doc onto github, so I just took a screenshot of it instead and sent it to myself on discord, and copied the image address.

### 5. Reflect with your partner on a difficulty you had with coding this app. How did collaboration help you overcome the challenge?

 I was absent for one day during the activity, which made it hard to work on this together. But, we overcame this by calling each other after school and working on it together at home.
