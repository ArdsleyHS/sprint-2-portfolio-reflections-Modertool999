# 2.6 Reflection Questions

### 1. In your own words, give a sentence that would explain to a friend the difference between the WWW and the Internet.

The Inerent is  anetwork of networks, while the WWW is where documents are identified by the HTTP protocol.

### 2. (POGIL) List a beneficial effect and a harmful effect for a social media app that you discussed in your POGIL group. Are the effects on society, culture, or economics? Include a screenshot of the Venn diagram you made with your group.

Social Media: Facebook

Beneficial effects:

Information can be shared easily online
You can reconnect with old friends

Harmful effects:

Instagram location services can expose your location
Cyber Bullying

The effects are on society, culture, and economics. Our culture is shifting towards an online based society, and social media plays and will play a big part in that. The effects are also economic, because business can be conducted through facebook. Finally, the effects are also on society (which is similar to culture), because facebook alreay dominates a huge part of big tech (which is also an economic effect), and can influenc how society acts in order to make as much money as possible. For example, they get people addicted to teh app to make more money.


### 3. (POGIL) If you were a developer of one of the social media apps that you discussed, how would you reduce the harmful effects?

I would reduce teh harmful effects by trying to make the app less addictive for people, especially the youth.
