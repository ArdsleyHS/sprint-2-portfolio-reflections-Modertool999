# 2.3 Reflection Questions

### 1. (POGIL) Write an algorithm using the 4 simple commands to navigate the robot through the maze in the POGIL question listed in your online textbook.

MOVE_FORWARD
MOVE_FORWARD
ROTATE_RIGHT
MOVE_FORWARD
MOVE_FORWARD
MOVE_FORWARD
MOVE_FORWARD
ROTATE_LEFT
MOVE_FORWARD
MOVE_FORWARD


### 2. (POGIL) Write an algorithm using repetition control structures to navigate the robot through the maze referenced above.

REPEAT 2 times
	MOVE_FORWARD
ROTATE_RIGHT
REPEAT 4 times
	MOVE_FORWARD
ROTATE_LEFT
REPEAT 2 times
	MOVE_FORWARD



### 3. (POGIL) Include a description or a photo of your drawing of a maze that the general algorithm in the POGIL exercise CANNOT solve.

### 4. (POGIL) Write an algorithm for washing a stack of 10 items that are cups and dishes mixed together, where the rule is that cups are washed in hot water and dishes in cold water. Use simple commands like **hot_wash** and **cold_wash**. You may also use the control structures **IF** and **REPEAT n times**. Identify the parts of your algorithm that are examples of *Sequence, Selection and Repetition*.

REPEAT 10 times 
  If DISH 
    COLD_WASH
  Else HOT_WASH
